    <h1>Occasion</h1>
    <p>
        Generally makar sankranti falls on 14 January, and is called Makar Sankranti or other names in the Indian 
        subcontinent. Maghe Sankranti is a major harvest festival celebrated in Madhesh and Tharuhat of Nepal. The 
        movement of the sun from one zodiac sign into another is called Sankranti and as the Sun moves into the Capricorn 
        zodiacal sign known as Makara, this occasion is named as Makara Sankranti in the Pahari context. It is one of the 
        few Nepalese festivals of Madhesi and Tharu people celebrate it on a fixed date, i.e., 14 January because this 
        solar festival in the honor of deity Surya follows the solar cycle of the Bikrami calendar, unlike other festivals
         that follow lunar cycle.[4][5]

Maghe Sankranti is regarded as marking the beginning of an auspicious phase in Nepal

in the ancient epics like Mahabharata. So, apart from socio-geographical importance, Maghe Sankranti holds historical
