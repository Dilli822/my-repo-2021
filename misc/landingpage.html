 <h1> Introduction </h1>
 <p>
 Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
 It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

 Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. 
 HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
      <br>      
 HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may
 be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text
Such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.

          <ul>
     <li>HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages.</li>
    <br><li>Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current
     maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.</li>

   <h1>Development</h1> 
<p>
In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN
 researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext 
 system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee
 and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not 
formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes[4] from 1990 he listed[5] "some of the many areas in which hypertext 
is used" and put an encyclopedia first.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on
         the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991</li><br>
         <li>HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other 
             material into visual or audible web pages.</li><br>
<li>Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can
     be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS.</li><br>

<h1>HTML versions timeline</h1>
<p>
   
<li>HTML 2</li>
November 24, 1995
HTML 2.0 was published as RFC 1866. Supplemental RFCs added capabilities:
November 25, 1995: RFC 1867 (form-based file upload)
May 1996: RFC 1942 (tables)
August 1996: RFC 1980 (client-side image maps)
January 1997: RFC 2070 (internationalization)
<li>HTML 3</li>
January 14, 1997
HTML 3.2[15] was published as a W3C Recommendation. It was the first version developed and standardized exclusively by the W3C, as the IETF had closed its HTML Working Group on September 12, 1996.[16]
Initially code-named "Wilbur",[17] HTML 3.2 dropped math formulas entirely, reconciled overlap among various proprietary extensions and adopted most of Netscape's visual markup tags. Netscape's blink element and Microsoft's marquee element were omitted due to a mutual agreement between the two companies.[13] A markup for mathematical formulas similar to that in HTML was not standardized until 14 months later in MathML.
<li>HTML 4</li>
December 18, 1997
HTML 4.0[18] was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers three variations:
Strict, in which deprecated elements are forbidden
Transitional, in which deprecated elements are allowed
Frameset, in which mostly only frame related elements are allowed.
Initially code-named "Cougar",[17] HTML 4.0 adopted many browser-specific element types and attributes, but at the same time sought to phase out Netscape's visual markup features by marking them as deprecated in favor of style sheets. HTML 4 is an SGML application conforming to ISO 8879 – SGML.[19]
April 24, 1998
HTML 4.0[20] was reissued with minor edits without incrementing the version number.
December 24, 1999
HTML 4.01[21] was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers the same three variations as HTML 4.0 and its last errata were published on May 12, 2001.
May 2000
ISO/IEC 15445:2000[22][23] ("ISO HTML", based on HTML 4.01 Strict) was published as an ISO/IEC international standard. In the ISO this standard falls in the domain of the ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34 (ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1, Subcommittee 34 – Document description and processing languages).[22]
After HTML 4.01, there was no new version of HTML for many years as development of the parallel, XML-based language XHTML occupied the W3C's HTML Working Group through the early and mid-2000s.
<li>HTML 5</li>
Main article: HTML5
October 28, 2014
HTML5[24] was published as a W3C Recommendation.[25]
November 1, 2016
HTML 5.1[26] was published as a W3C Recommendation.[27][28]
December 14, 2017
HTML 5.2[29] was published as a W3C Recommendation

        HTML Application
        Main article: HTML Application
        An HTML Application (HTA; file extension ".hta") is a Microsoft Windows application that uses HTML and Dynamic 
        HTML in a browser to provide the application's graphical interface. A regular HTML file is confined to the 
        security model of the web browser's security, communicating only to web servers and manipulating only web page 
        objects and site cookies. An HTA runs as a fully trusted application and therefore has more privileges, like 
        creation/editing/removal of files and Windows Registry entries. Because they operate outside the browser's 
        security model, HTAs cannot be executed via HTTP, but must be downloaded (just like an EXE file) and executed 
        from local file system.

         <h1>Data types</h1>
         <p>
            Data types
            HTML defines several data types for element content, such as script data and stylesheet data, and a 
            plethora of types for attribute values, including IDs, names, URIs, numbers, units of length, languages, 
            media descriptors, colors, character encodings, dates and times, and so on. All of these data types are 
            specializations of character data.

         <h1> Summary of specification versions</h1>
         <p>
 As this list demonstrates, the loose versions of the specification are maintained for legacy support. 
 However, contrary to popular misconceptions, the move to XHTML does not imply a removal of this legacy support. 
Rather the X in XML stands for extensible and the W3C is modularizing the entire specification and opening it up
to independent extensions. The primary achievement in the move from XHTML 1.0 to XHTML 1.1 is the modularization 
 of the entire specification. The strict version of HTML is deployed in XHTML 1.1 through a set of modular extensions
to the base XHTML 1.1 specification. Likewise, someone looking for the loose (transitional) or frameset specifications
will find similar extended XHTML 1.1 support (much of it is contained in the legacy or frame modules). The modularization
also allows for separate features to develop on their own timetable. So for example, XHTML 1.1 will allow quicker
 migration to emerging XML standards such as MathML (a presentational and semantic math language based on XML) and
  XForms—a new highly advanced web-form technology to replace the existing HTML forms.<Br><br><br>
In summary, the HTML 4 specification primarily reined in all the various HTML implementations into a single clearly 
written specification based on SGML. XHTML 1.0, ported this specification, as is, to the new XML defined specification.
Next, XHTML 1.1 takes advantage of the extensible nature of XML and modularizes the whole specification. XHTML 2.0 was 
intended to be the first step in adding new features to the specification in a standards-body-based approach.
