    PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) is an online multiplayer battle royale game developed and published
      by PUBG Corporation, a subsidiary of South Korean video
       game company Bluehole. The game is based on previous 
       mods that were created by Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene
        for other games, inspired by the 2000   Japanese film 
        Battle Royale, and expanded into a standalone game under
        Greene's creative direction. In the game, up to one hundred players
         parachute onto an island and scavenge for weapons and equipment to
          kill others while avoiding getting killed themselves. The available
          safe area of the game's map decreases in size over time, directing 
          surviving players into tighter areas to force encounters. The last 
          player or team standing wins the round.
