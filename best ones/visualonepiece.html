   <p>
    When compared to series like Naruto and Bleach, One Piece sits on the top of the castle when it comes to well-written characters. While the other two have many great character moments, One Piece is on a whole other level, boasting an expansive cast of fully-realized and likable personalities that compliment each other brilliantly.

    Each character feels real, no matter what tropes they might exhibit, and none of their changes or development feel forced. While the competition's characters may have inconsistent motives and underwhelming subplots dragging them down, One Piece is 100% organic.
