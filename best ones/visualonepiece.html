 <h1>How One piece became best anime and manga selling?</h1>

   <p>
    When compared to series like Naruto and Bleach, One Piece sits on the top of the 
    castle when it comes to well-written characters. While the other two have many great 
    character moments, One Piece is on a whole other level, boasting an expansive cast of fully-realized and likable personalities that compliment each other brilliantly.
 Each character feels real, no matter what tropes they might exhibit, and none of their changes 
 or development feel forced. While the competition's characters may have inconsistent motives and 
 underwhelming subplots dragging them down, One Piece is 100% organic.
 Wano Country[3] is a country in the New World that is not affiliated with the World Government.[4] It is
  currently occupied by the Beasts Pirates as their territory, under Kaido, one of the Four Emperors.[5]
