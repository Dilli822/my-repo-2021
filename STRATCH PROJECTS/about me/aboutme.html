  I want to be officer cadet in Nepal army because it's a final and biggest opportunity for me to make my career and fulfill my incomplete dream.
  I could get chance to serve the nation army and can support my family financially.i could make my parents feel proud and secure.they could get more persitge in the society  
  becoming cadet has became my aim and it's final chance for me to prove myself.
  serving in nation defense is the best career option I have seen till now!
  My remaining life whole destiny  depends upon it.
