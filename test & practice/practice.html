            Attack on Titan has released a new poster for its fourth and final season. After first being revealed following the end of the third season's second part, the fourth and final season of Attack on Titan has been one of the most anticipated releases of the year. There's something a bit more special surrounding this new season because not only is it taking on the massive final arc of Hajime Isayama's original series, being animated by new studio MAPPA, and the fact it's starting outside of the standard Fall 2020 anime season, but we know so very little about how the final adaptation has shaped up.

            With the premiere of Attack on Titan's fourth and final season only just a day away from the time of this writing, the official Twitter account for the final season has revealed a brand new poster teasing the huge conflicts in the series to come. Like seen in the debut trailer for the season, we're going to be introduced to all kinds of new human and Titan threats. Check it out for yourself below:
