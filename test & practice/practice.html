The Gurkha Contingent is a line department of
the Singapore Police Force consisting 
primarily of Gurkhas from Nepal.<br>
 Members of the GC are trained to be highly skilled and are selected 
 for their display of strong discipline and dedication in their tasks.
 <br>
 <br>Why are Gurkhas in Singapore?<Br>
<br>Reputed for their fearless military prowess and loyalty, the Gurkhas in 
Southeast Asia were initially brought to Singapore as special soldiers on
 the payroll of the British Army. Today, the Gurkha Contingent is a unit
  in the Singapore Police Force and serves as a neutral safekeeping
   and counter-terrorism force.
