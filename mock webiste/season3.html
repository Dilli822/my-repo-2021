         <h2>Brief</h2>
         <p>
            The season follows Eren and his fellow soldiers from the Survey Corps
            who are still fighting for their survival against the terrifying 
            Titans. However, threats arise not only from the Titans beyond the 
            walls, but from the humans within them as well. After being rescued 
            from the Colossal and Armored Titans, all seems well for the soldiers,
            until the government suddenly demands custody of Eren and Historia. 
            Sought after by the government, Levi and his new squad must evade 
            their adversaries in hopes of keeping Eren and Historia safe.
