The season follows Eren Jaeger and his friends from the 104th Training Corps
 who have just begun to become full members of the Survey Corps. After fighting
  the Female Titan, Eren finds no time to rest as a horde of Titans is 
  approaching Wall Rose and the battle for humanity continues. As the Survey
   Corps races to save the wall, they uncover more about the invading Titans 
   and the dark secrets of their own members.
The score is composed by Hiroyuki Sawano. The opening theme song is "Opfert
 eure Herzen!" (心臓を捧げよ！, Shinzō o Sasageyo!, lit. "Dedicate Your Hearts!")
  by Linked Horizon, and the ending theme song is "Yūgure no Tori" (夕暮れの鳥, 
  it. "Birds of Twilight") by Shinsei Kamattechan.

   <u> new titans were revealed beast titan and jaw titan.<br>
    A titan was found inside the wall thereby revealing that the walls are made of titans and these titans must not be exposed to sunlight (No further explanation though)
    Normal humans were converted into titans (Only a few know about this).<br>
     The people of Conny’s village were converted into titans that started attacking.<br>
    Jaw titan is Ymir, Collosal titan is Bertolt and Armored titan is Reiner
    Eren kicks armored titan’s ass in episode 7 (WORTH IT!!) but end up being captured by Bertolt and Reiner along with Ymir.<br>
    They were on the way to their hometown but gets stopped by the Survey corps under Commander Erwin .<br>
    Finally it seems that Eren has something called Coordinate that allows him to control titans.<br>
    Eren is saved by the Survey corps and Ymir stays to fight along side with Bertolt and Reiner outside the walls.<Br>
    Also looks like there will be a social and economical turmoil within the walls because of high population to food ratio.<Br>
    In the last scene, the human form of the beast titan is revealed.</u></content>
