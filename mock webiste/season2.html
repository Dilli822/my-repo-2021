The season follows Eren Jaeger and his friends from the 104th Training Corps
 who have just begun to become full members of the Survey Corps. After fighting
  the Female Titan, Eren finds no time to rest as a horde of Titans is 
  approaching Wall Rose and the battle for humanity continues. As the Survey
   Corps races to save the wall, they uncover more about the invading Titans 
   and the dark secrets of their own members.
The score is composed by Hiroyuki Sawano. The opening theme song is "Opfert
 eure Herzen!" (心臓を捧げよ！, Shinzō o Sasageyo!, lit. "Dedicate Your Hearts!")
  by Linked Horizon, and the ending theme song is "Yūgure no Tori" (夕暮れの鳥, 
  it. "Birds of Twilight") by Shinsei Kamattechan.[4]

 Erwin leads the expedition away from Wall Rose, Hange requests 
 a horseback ride to Ragako to see the immobilized Titan, but 
 Moblit decides to go in her stead since she is badly injured. 
 Meanwhile, in the Forest of Giant Trees, as Eren and Ymir 
 continue to regenerate their limbs, Ymir points out that not
only are they surrounded by Titans, but also Reiner and
 Bertholdt stole their omni-directional mobility gear. Reiner 
 and Bertholdt plan to take Eren and Ymir to their hometown, but
 waiting until nightfall when the surrounding Titans cannot
move. Eren is reminded by Ymir that they are in no position to fight 
or flee until they regenerate. Reiner begins to ramble about his duty
as a soldier and as a warrior, which Ymir deduces that there is 
 confusion between his undercover and real personas. Ymir is highly
concerned about the Beast Titan, who caused the recent Titan 
invasion and may be their real enemy. Reiner then uses Ymir's 
concern for Christa's safety as leverage to drive a wedge between 
 Eren and Ymir. The discussion is interrupted by the sound of flare
 guns, signalling the arrival of the Scouts.</content>
