                The fourth and final season of the Attack on Titan anime television series, titled Attack on Titan: The Final Season, is produced by MAPPA and directed by Yūichirō Hayashi, replacing Tetsurō Araki and Masashi Koizuka. Scriptwriter Hiroshi Seko took over the series composition from Yasuko Kobayashi, and Tomohiro Kishi replaced Kyōji Asano as character designer due to the series switching production studios.[1] The season covers the "Marley" (chapters 91–106) and "War for Paradis" (chapters 107 onwards) arcs from the original manga by Hajime Isayama.

On September 22, 2020, Crunchyroll and Funimation announced that the final season would be streaming "later this year".[2] The season premiered on NHK General TV on December 7, 2020 at 12:10 a.m. JST.[3] In the United States, Adult Swim's Toonami programming block began airing Funimation's English dub on January 10, 2021 at 12:30 a.m. ET.[4] Currently, 16 episodes have been listed for the home releases for the season.[5]

The score is directed by Masafumi Mima and composed by Hiroyuki Sawano and Kohta Yamamoto.[1] The opening theme song is "My War" (僕の戦争, "Boku no Sensō") performed by Shinsei Kamattechan, and the ending theme song is "Shock" (衝撃, "Shōgeki") performed by Yūko Andō.[6]
